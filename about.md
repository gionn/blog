My name is **Giovanni Toraldo** and I was born in [Lucca][lucca] (Italy). 🇮🇹

I am an [Open Source enthusiast 🐧][1] with [SuperCow Powers 🐮][2], a
Java/Ruby/whatever developer 🧑🏻‍💻, writer of the [OpenNebula 3 Cloud Computing][3]
[book ☁️][4].

I currently work as DevOps Engineer at [Hyland Software][8] in the [Alfresco][9]
engineering. Some of my work involves the maintaining of the open source
[Ansible Playbook][10], the [helm charts][11] and [build tools][12].

Previously I was developing [Cloudesire][6], the platform I co-founded in 2016 that
later got acquired by [Engineering D.HUB][5].

During the weekends I shoot with a [medieval crossbow 🎯][7] for a reenactment
association in the city of [Lucca][13].

My resume (CV) is [here](https://gionn.net/files/giovanni-toraldo-cv.pdf).

During these first hot-days in Florence, I've attended the <a href="http://www.evaflorence.it/">EVA Florence 2012</a> conference, presenting a talk with <a href="http://twitter.com/ccorsani">Cristiano Corsani</a> about a project for the National Library of Florence (<a href="http://www.bncf.firenze.sbn.it">BNCF</a>), covering the deployment of a small Private Cloud using exclusively open source software, for serving internal and public BNCF services.

The proposed solution includes a virtualization stack running on commody hardware, using the Linux KVM hypervisor, managed by Proxmox 2.0 and with a GlusterFS shared storage.

I hope to write down some article to share the most interesting bits of this configuration, but time is not our friend.

Here are the slides of the presentation "Open low-cost HA cluster cloud", hoping that they will satisfy your curiosity:

Thanks to everyone who helped us in this journey!

It was an absolute thrill to return to the [Incontro
DevOps](https://www.incontrodevops.it) stage after 4 years, my fifth time as a
speaker there! Reuniting with old friends and meeting new ones made the
experience even more special. A huge shoutout to the incredible speakers I've
had the pleasure of watching so far.

Lastly, a heartfelt thank you to everyone who attended my talk. I especially
appreciate the engaging discussions and interactions at the end!

It was an absolute thrill to return to the [Incontro
DevOps](https://www.incontrodevops.it) stage after 4 years, my fifth time as a
speaker there! Reuniting with old friends and meeting new ones made the
experience even more special. A huge shoutout to the incredible speakers I've
had the pleasure of watching so far.

Lastly, a heartfelt thank you to everyone who attended my talk. I especially
appreciate the engaging discussions and interactions at the end!

> Keeping versions of softwares up-to-date is becoming a challenge, especially
> when tools fail to keep up with the constantly evolving ecosystems. We explore

> the journey towards building robust update pipelines using the open source
> [updatecli](https://www.updatecli.io/) tool.

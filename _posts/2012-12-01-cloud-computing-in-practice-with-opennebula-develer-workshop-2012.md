These months have been quite busy for me, but I always try to find some time to seed on local communities the knowledge of some particular Open Source software, especially for OpenNebula (someone called me <em>evangelist</em>, but it is really too much for what am I doing).

On 26 Novembre 2012 I carried out a workshop, sponsored by <a href="http://www.develer.com">Develer</a> (offering space, organization and drinks), that attracted <a href="http://workshop.develer.com/ilcloudcomputingriempielaplatea/">quite many people</a> around the Florence area, spending a nice evening discussing about Cloud Computing with OpenNebula.

The presentation covered some basic topics, like what OpenNebula is and why users should use it, and continued with a live demo using the [OpenNebula](http://www.opennebula.org) Sandbox VM.

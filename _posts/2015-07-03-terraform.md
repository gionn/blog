Have you ever found tedious to manage cloud services on a scattered ecosystem of GUI and CLI tools pushed by every vendor?

Did you find awful to think on how to do the right things in the right order to change infrastructure to your desired state?

Have you ever destroyed the wrong production VM or removed the wrong DNS record?

Let's take a look to Terraform, an open-source tool for building, changing, and combining infrastructure safely and efficiently, brought to us by Hashicorp (have you ever heard about Vagrant?).
